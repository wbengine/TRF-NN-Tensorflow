BECAUSE MOST MEMBERS ARE INDIVIDUAL BROKERS THE COMMITTEE COULD HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY WINNING APPROVAL
IN JANUARY THE BEAVERTON OREGON TOY MAKER DISCLOSED TALKS CONCERNING ITS POSSIBLE TAKEOVER BY A THIRD PARTY WHO PROPOSED A FRIENDLY TRANSACTION
BUT THE DISCUSSIONS SUBSEQUENTLY ENDED BECAUSE THE TWO SIDES COULDN'T AGREE ON FINANCIAL AND OTHER TERMS

THE THIRD PARTY WASN'T IDENTIFIED
MOREOVER B. C. C. I. OFFICIALS AND INDUSTRY ANALYSTS STRESSED THAT AS MUCH AS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE BANK'S DEPOSIT BASE IS MADE UP OF RETAIL DEPOSITS

IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS ALWAYS PURSUED A POLICY OF KEEPING ITS BALANCE SHEET RELATIVELY LIQUID INSIDERS AND COMPETITORS SAID
YET WHEN WE DISCUSS SOCIAL POLICY WE TALK AS IF MONEY THE POVERTY RATE WAS ALL THAT MATTERS
IT IS THE GENERIC STAND IN FOR THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF OUR AGE MR. MURRAY WRITES

THE OCTOBER RISE WAS INITIALLY REPORTED AS A ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT DROP
IN YESTERDAY'S RELEASE THE DEPARTMENT ALSO REVISED THE SEPTEMBER PERFORMANCE TO A ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT RISE AFTER PREVIOUSLY REPORTING IT AS UNCHANGED
FOR THE KOREAN ECONOMY HE FAVORS FREE TRADE
I THINK WE HAVE TO OPEN OUR MARKETS
HE ADDS THAT MORE EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO REALIZE A FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME BUT HE IS SHORT ON SPECIFICS
THE POLICY NEEDED FOR THIS WILL BE FURTHER DEVELOPED
YESTERDAY'S ACTION DIDN'T AFFECT A FOURTH L. T. V. PLAN THE PENSION AGENCY TOOK OVER IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX

IN TODAY'S MARKET THEY ARE ALMOST NEVER AVAILABLE
THERE ARE TOO MANY FOREIGN AND INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS WILLING TO PAY HIGHER PRICES THAN WE ARE
MANY INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS CONFESS TO HOLDING MORE CASH THAN USUAL
MANY INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS CONFESS TO HOLDING MORE CASH THAN USUAL
IN THE BULL MARKET OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN CASH POSITIONS EXCEEDING FIVE PERCENT OF ASSETS WOULD HAVE HELD DOWN OVERALL RETURNS
IN THE BULL MARKET OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN CASH POSITIONS EXCEEDING FIVE PERCENT OF ASSETS WOULD HAVE HELD DOWN OVERALL RETURNS
NOW MANY INSTITUTIONS SAY THEIR CASH LEVELS ARE TEN PERCENT OR MORE AND A FEW ARE AT THIRTY PERCENT OR MORE
NOW MANY INSTITUTIONS SAY THEIR CASH LEVELS ARE TEN PERCENT OR MORE AND A FEW ARE AT THIRTY PERCENT OR MORE
THE NEED FOR ECONOMY HAS ALSO HELD TO A HANDFUL THE EXPENSIVE BUT ALL IMPORTANT LONGITUDINAL SURVEYS THAT FOLLOW A GROUP OF PEOPLE OVER MANY YEARS
FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE WAY ELDERLY PEOPLE MOVE FROM INDEPENDENT LIVING TO COMMUNITY CARE TO PERHAPS A NURSING HOME OR HOSPITAL
WITH SUCH KNOWLEDGE PLANNERS COULD BETTER DETERMINE WHETHER MORE COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES COULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR NURSING HOMES OR HOSPITALS

THE COMPANY SAID THE WESTERN COUNCIL OF INDUSTRIAL WORKERS RATIFIED ECONOMIC TERMS OF THE NEW THREE YEAR AGREEMENT ON FRIDAY
IT SAID VARIOUS LOCAL PLANT ISSUES MUST STILL BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE CONTRACT IS CONCLUDED
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE
WELL TO BEGIN WITH MR. MILKEN ISN'T RUNNING FOR OFFICE OR FOR MR. CONGENIALITY
HE IS THE HEAD OF THE HUGE JUNK BOND OPERATION OF DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED
AND MORE THAN THAT HE IS A CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY'S INSIDER TRADING SCANDAL
IN A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR PAGE CIVIL COMPLAINT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION LAST MONTH ACCUSED THE POWERFUL FINANCIER OF A CATALOG OF SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
HE HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT BEFORE LONG HE MAY BE INDICTED ON CRIMINAL CHARGES
AN F. B. I. REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES REPORTED IN THE U. S. LAST YEAR INCREASED FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THERE WERE THIRTEEN POINT NINE MILLION CRIMES REPORTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
MURDERS ROSE TWO POINT NINE PERCENT TO TWENTY THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE IN THE PERIOD
THE SUIT WAS FILED UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT WHICH ALLOWS PRIVATE CITIZENS TO SUE ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT
UNDER THE LAW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CAN ELECT TO TAKE OVER AS PLAINTIFF
A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE DEPARTMENT SAID NO SUCH DECISION HAS YET BEEN MADE
IN ADDITION I. B. M.'S PRICING STRATEGY COULD HURT COMPETITORS
FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPANY PLANS BIG DISCOUNTS ON THE NEW ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLAR MACHINE FOR SCHOOLS A MAIN APPLE MARKET
ONE OF THE NEW P. C.S OFFERS ALMOST DOUBLE THE MEMORY AND SLIGHTLY MORE STORAGE FOR ELEVEN PERCENT LESS THAN THE COMPETING COMPAQ MACHINE
I. B. M. P. C.S TRADITIONALLY ARE PRICED HIGHER THAN RIVAL BRANDS TO TYPICALLY MUST UNDERCUT I. B. M. PRICES BY FIFTEEN PERCENT
THE TASK FORCE REPORT ISN'T ALL BAD
IT DOES CALL FOR ELIMINATING SOME GOVERNMENT OBSTACLES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HEALTHY LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE MARKET
AND THE IDEA OF LETTING EMPLOYERS PRE FUND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSES IS SURELY BETTER THAN HAVING GOVERNMENT DO IT
ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR TREASURY ISSUES LAST WEEK PLUNGED ABOUT THREE POINTS OR ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
PRICES WERE DOWN EVERY DAY BUT THURSDAY WHEN THEY ROSE ONLY SLIGHTLY
THE YIELD ON THE LATEST THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BONDS SURGED TO EIGHT POINT EIGHT THREE PERCENT FROM EIGHT POINT FIVE SIX PERCENT A WEEK EARLIER
SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES DATA GENERAL HAS TRIED TO COMPETE HEAD ON WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION FOR LARGE CUSTOMERS

SINCE THEN HOWEVER RESULTS HAVE BEEN POOR
PER SHARE EARNINGS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR FELL ABOUT TWENTY ONE PERCENT THE COMPANY ESTIMATED REFLECTING AN EIGHTEEN PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING
THE BRANFORD CONNECTICUT BASED COMPANY HAD STOCK OFFERINGS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN TO REDUCE DEBT

THE PARENT COMPANY ADDED THAT IT MAY SEEK OTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE
STOCK AND BOND PRICES FELL FRIDAY AMID CONCERN ABOUT LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE BUDGET TALKS
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS DROPPED TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO OH TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POINT OH ONE
THE DOLLAR WAS LITTLE CHANGED
THAT ASSESSMENT IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE APPROPRIATE NOW MARKET ANALYSTS SAY
ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OF STRONG GROWTH EARLIER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS THE NEW ISSUE MARKET FOR INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES AND EQUITY RELATED BONDS
SUCH ACTIVITY HAS ALL BUT ENDED SINCE STOCK PRICES PLUNGED THE ANALYSTS SAY
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS FUELED THE RISE BY SHIFTING ASSETS TO THE FUNDS IN RESPONSE TO DECLINING RATES AVAILABLE ON SHORT TERM SECURITIES IN THE MARKET
ALSO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS' CONCERN OVER VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE SHE SAID
LAST FRIDAY THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE POSTED ITS THIRD BIGGEST POINT DECLINE EVER
THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED OFF SEVEN POINT FOUR POINTS AT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY POINT SEVEN
VOLUME WAS A MODERATE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION SHARES PICKING UP SLIGHTLY FROM WEDNESDAY'S FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX WAS OFF FIVE POINT TWO POINTS AT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE POINT FIVE
JOB SECURITY CLAUSES GIVE UNIONS SOMETHING POSITIVE TO TAKE BACK TO THEIR MEMBERS AT MODEST COST TO EMPLOYERS
BUT THEY CAN LOOK MORE GENEROUS THAN THEY ARE
AUTO CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR JOB SECURITY BUT BECAUSE THEY LIMIT THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR IT THEY HAVEN'T PREVENTED SIZABLE LAYOFFS
WE COULD DISTRIBUTE THE BONDS IN JAPAN IN EUROPE IN THE U. K. BUT NOT IN THE U. S. MR. LABRECQUE SAID
THESE POWERS ARE IMPORTANT TO US
THESE POWERS ARE IMPORTANT TO US
OUR CUSTOMERS WANT THEM
OUR CUSTOMERS WANT THEM
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER U. S. BANKS WILL BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER U. S. BANKS WILL BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE
ROBINS SAID MR. WOLF FORTY THREE YEARS OLD IS LEAVING AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS WITH THE COMPANY FOR A POSITION WITH A TEXAS HEALTH CARE CONCERN

THE CHIEF TRADER IN NEW YORK FOR A TOKYO BASED BANK AGREES
EVEN IF JAPANESE INVESTORS DON'T SELL DOLLARS SOMEBODY ELSE WILL HE SAYS
THE TREND IS INEVITABLE UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE WHOLE WORLD
THE TREND IS INEVITABLE UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE WHOLE WORLD
CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEGUN TO TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS TO IMPROVE THE CREDIT BUDGET
A PILOT LOAN SALE PROGRAM APPROVED LAST YEAR WOULD PROVIDE A VIRTUALLY RISK FREE TEST OF THIS APPROACH
INITIAL WALL STREET ENTHUSIASM HAS SURPRISED EVEN PRIVATIZATION ADVOCATES
THE FIRST SALES ARE EXPECTED TO GO TO MARKET SOMETIME THIS SUMMER
THE OFFERING WILL COMPRISE SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS DUE NOVEMBER SECOND AND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS MATURING NEXT FEBRUARY FIRST
ALL THE BONDS WILL BE DATED NEXT MONDAY
INTEREST RATES WILL BE ANNOUNCED WEDNESDAY
THE CENTRAL BANKS HAVE LITTLE CHANCE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE DOLLAR'S FALL
WHEN POSSIBLE THEY TRY TO REDUCE THEIR U. S. CURRENCY PORTFOLIOS BY SELLING DOLLARS BACK INTO CALMER MARKETS
TRADERS SAY THE BUNDESBANK DID THIS WHEN THE DOLLAR STRENGTHENED IN LATE JULY AND EARLY AUGUST
THE BOSTON PROPERTY WAS FULLY OCCUPIED A BROKER CLOSE TO THE BUILDING SAID
IT WAS A DONE DEAL
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY CAME BACK AND SAID WE AREN'T BUYING AT THIS YIELD
I SAID GIVE ME A PRICE AND THEY SAID NO
THERE ARE TWO ISSUES TO CONSIDER
FIRST WHAT WAS ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S BELIEF ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY OF HELPING THE NICARAGUAN DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE
SECOND DID ADMIRAL POINDEXTER BELIEVE WHAT HE AND COLONEL NORTH WERE DOING WAS LEGAL
CERTAIN PRICES HAVE RISEN AT A BRISK PACE THROUGHOUT THIS DECADE
HEALTH CARE INFLATION FOR INSTANCE HASN'T DROPPED BELOW SIX PERCENT ANNUALLY AND THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS RISEN EVEN FASTER
BUT UNTIL RECENTLY INFLATION IN HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER SERVICES WAS OFFSET BY FLAT OR FALLING PRICES FOR MANY MANUFACTURED GOODS AND FARM COMMODITIES
THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR AND THE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY HOWEVER ARE NOW ADDING DEMAND AND CAUSING THOSE PRICES TO RISE TOO
THE LOGIC APPARENTLY IS THAT WE'LL HAVE TO RAISE OUR RATES TO DEFEND THE DOLLAR SAID PETER CANELO A PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT BEAR STEARNS
BUT HE SAID THAT WOULD ONLY BE TRUE IF THE DOLLAR WERE WEAK
SINCE THE U. S. CURRENCY HAS STRENGTHENED SHARPLY IN RECENT WEEKS HE SEES NO NEED FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO PROTECT THE DOLLAR
YIELDS ON LONG TERM BONDS AFTER DROPPING AS LOW AS SEVEN POINT EIGHT THREE PERCENT EARLY LAST WEEK ARE BACK UP ABOVE EIGHT PERCENT

WE COULD DISTRIBUTE THE BONDS IN JAPAN IN EUROPE IN THE U. K. BUT NOT IN THE U. S. MR. LABRECQUE SAID
THAT'S NOT TO SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR A REBOUND IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS
THE THING THAT MOTIVATES WALL STREET IS SHORT TERM EARNINGS RESULTS AND THEY'RE JUST NOT THERE HE SAYS
AND WE CAN'T TELL YOU WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE
IT MIGHT BE A YEAR OR MORE BEFORE WE GET PAID
FEW OBSERVERS ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE COURT'S OTHER PROBLEMS
ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES OF THE U. S. COURTS ONLY HALF OF THE FIFTY BANKRUPTCY JUDGES WHOSE TERMS EXPIRE BY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL RETURN

SOMETIME NEXT YEAR HE SAID LAST WEEK WE'LL KNOW WHETHER THE FED'S PLAN HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL
FOR TAXPAYERS THE CHIEF ADVANTAGE OF PAYING BY THEIR CREDIT CARDS WOULD BE AN EXTRA TIME TO PAY

THERE ARE TOO MANY FOREIGN AND INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS WILLING TO PAY HIGHER PRICES THAN WE ARE
MANY INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS CONFESS TO HOLDING MORE CASH THAN USUAL
MANY INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS CONFESS TO HOLDING MORE CASH THAN USUAL
THE NEED FOR ECONOMY HAS ALSO HELD TO A HANDFUL THE EXPENSIVE BUT ALL IMPORTANT LONGITUDINAL SURVEYS THAT FOLLOW A GROUP OF PEOPLE OVER MANY YEARS
FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE WAY ELDERLY PEOPLE MOVE FROM INDEPENDENT LIVING TO COMMUNITY CARE TO PERHAPS A NURSING HOME OR HOSPITAL
WITH SUCH KNOWLEDGE PLANNERS COULD BETTER DETERMINE WHETHER MORE COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES COULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR NURSING HOMES OR HOSPITALS

THE COMPANY SAID THE WESTERN COUNCIL OF INDUSTRIAL WORKERS RATIFIED ECONOMIC TERMS OF THE NEW THREE YEAR AGREEMENT ON FRIDAY
IT SAID VARIOUS LOCAL PLANT ISSUES MUST STILL BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE CONTRACT IS CONCLUDED
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE
WELL TO BEGIN WITH MR. MILKEN ISN'T RUNNING FOR OFFICE OR FOR MR. CONGENIALITY
HE IS THE HEAD OF THE HUGE JUNK BOND OPERATION OF DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED
AND MORE THAN THAT HE IS A CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY'S INSIDER TRADING SCANDAL
IN A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR PAGE CIVIL COMPLAINT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION LAST MONTH ACCUSED THE POWERFUL FINANCIER OF A CATALOG OF SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
HE HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT BEFORE LONG HE MAY BE INDICTED ON CRIMINAL CHARGES
AN F. B. I. REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES REPORTED IN THE U. S. LAST YEAR INCREASED FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THERE WERE THIRTEEN POINT NINE MILLION CRIMES REPORTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
MURDERS ROSE TWO POINT NINE PERCENT TO TWENTY THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE IN THE PERIOD
THE SUIT WAS FILED UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT WHICH ALLOWS PRIVATE CITIZENS TO SUE ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT
UNDER THE LAW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CAN ELECT TO TAKE OVER AS PLAINTIFF
A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE DEPARTMENT SAID NO SUCH DECISION HAS BEEN MADE YET
IN ADDITION I. B. M.'S PRICING STRATEGY COULD HURT COMPETITORS
FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPANY PLANS BIG DISCOUNTS ON THE NEW ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLAR MACHINE FOR SCHOOLS A MAIN APPLE MARKET
ONE OF THE NEW P. C.S OFFERS ALMOST DOUBLE THE MEMORY AND SLIGHTLY MORE STORAGE FOR ELEVEN PERCENT LESS THAN THE COMPETING COMPAQ MACHINE
I. B. M. P. C.S TRADITIONAL ARE PRICED HIGHER THAN RIVAL BRANDS WHICH TYPICALLY MUST UNDERCUT I. B. M. PRICES BY FIFTEEN PERCENT
THE TASK FORCE REPORT ISN'T ALL BAD
IT DOES CALL FOR ELIMINATING SOME GOVERNMENT OBSTACLES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HEALTHY LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE MARKET
AND THE IDEA OF LETTING EMPLOYERS PRE FUND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSES IS SURELY BETTER THAN HAVING GOVERNMENT DO IT
ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR TREASURY ISSUES LAST WEEK PLUNGED ABOUT THREE POINTS OR ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
PRICES WERE DOWN EVERY DAY BUT THURSDAY WHEN THEY ROSE ONLY SLIGHTLY
THE YIELD ON THE LATEST THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BONDS SURGED TO EIGHT POINT EIGHT THREE PERCENT FROM EIGHT POINT FIVE SIX PERCENT A WEEK EARLIER

STOCK AND BOND PRICES FELL FRIDAY AMID CONCERN ABOUT LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE BUDGET TALKS
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS DROPPED TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO OH TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POINT OH ONE
THE DOLLAR WAS LITTLE CHANGED
THAT ASSESSMENT IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE APPROPRIATE NOW MARKET ANALYSTS SAY
ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OF STRONG GROWTH EARLIER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS THE NEW ISSUE MARKET FOR INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES AND EQUITY RELATED BONDS
SUCH ACTIVITY HAS ALL BUT ENDED SINCE STOCK PRICES PLUNGED THE ANALYSTS SAY
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS FUELED THE RISE BY SHIFTING ASSETS TO THE FUNDS IN RESPONSE TO DECLINING RATES AVAILABLE ON SHORT TERM SECURITIES IN THE MARKET
ALSO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS' CONCERN OVER VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE SHE SAID
LAST FRIDAY THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE POSTED ITS THIRD BIGGEST POINT DECLINE EVER
THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED OFF SEVEN POINT FOUR POINTS AT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY POINT SEVEN
VOLUME WAS A MODERATE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION SHARES PICKING UP SLIGHTLY FROM WEDNESDAY'S FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX WAS OFF FIVE POINT TWO POINTS AT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE POINT FIVE
JOB SECURITY CLAUSES GIVE UNIONS SOMETHING POSITIVE TO TAKE BACK TO THEIR MEMBERS AT MODEST COST TO EMPLOYERS
BUT THEY CAN LOOK MORE GENEROUS THAN THEY ARE
AUTO CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR JOB SECURITY BUT BECAUSE THEY LIMIT THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR IT THEY HAVEN'T PREVENTED SIZABLE LAYOFFS
WE COULD DISTRIBUTE THE BONDS IN JAPAN IN EUROPE IN THE U. K. BUT NOT IN THE U. S. MR. LABRECQUE SAID

THE CHIEF TRADER IN NEW YORK FOR A TOKYO BASED BANK AGREES
EVEN IF JAPANESE INVESTORS DON'T SELL DOLLARS SOMEBODY ELSE WILL HE SAYS
CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEGUN TO TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS TO IMPROVE THE CREDIT BUDGET
A PILOT LOAN SALE PROGRAM APPROVED LAST YEAR WOULD PROVIDE A VIRTUALLY RISK FREE TEST OF THIS APPROACH
INITIAL WALL STREET ENTHUSIASM HAS SURPRISED EVEN PRIVATIZATION ADVOCATES
THE FIRST SALES ARE EXPECTED TO GO TO MARKET SOMETIME THIS SUMMER
THE OFFERING WILL COMPRISE SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS DUE NOVEMBER SECOND AND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS MATURING NEXT FEBRUARY FIRST

THE CENTRAL BANKS HAVE LITTLE CHANCE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE DOLLAR'S FALL
WHEN POSSIBLE THEY TRY TO REDUCE THEIR U. S. CURRENCY PORTFOLIOS BY SELLING DOLLARS BACK INTO CALMER MARKETS
TRADERS SAY THE BUNDESBANK DID THIS WHEN THE DOLLAR STRENGTHENED IN LATE JULY AND EARLY AUGUST
THE BOSTON PROPERTY WAS FULLY OCCUPIED A BROKER CLOSE TO THE BUILDING SAID
IT WAS A DONE DEAL
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY CAME BACK AND SAID WE AREN'T BUYING AT THIS YIELD

THERE ARE TWO ISSUES TO CONSIDER
FIRST WHAT WAS ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S BELIEF ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY OF HELPING THE NICARAGUAN DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE
SECOND DID ADMIRAL POINDEXTER BELIEVE WHAT HE AND COLONEL NORTH WERE DOING WAS LEGAL
CERTAIN PRICES HAVE RISEN AT A BRISK PACE THROUGHOUT THIS DECADE
HEALTH CARE INFLATION FOR INSTANCE HASN'T DROPPED BELOW SIX PERCENT ANNUALLY AND THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS RISEN EVEN FASTER
BUT UNTIL RECENTLY INFLATION IN HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER SERVICES WAS OFFSET BY FLAT OR FALLING PRICES FOR MANY MANUFACTURED GOODS AND FARM COMMODITIES
THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR AND THE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY HOWEVER ARE NOW ADDING DEMAND AND CAUSING THOSE PRICES TO RISE TOO
THE LOGIC APPARENTLY IS THAT WE'LL HAVE TO RAISE OUR RATES TO DEFEND THE DOLLAR SAID PETER CANELO A PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT BEAR STEARNS
BUT HE SAID THAT WOULD ONLY BE TRUE IF THE DOLLAR WERE WEAK
SINCE THE U. S. CURRENCY HAS STRENGTHENED SHARPLY IN RECENT WEEKS HE SEES NO NEED FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO PROTECT THE DOLLAR
IN THE BULL MARKET OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN CASH POSITIONS EXCEEDING FIVE PERCENT OF ASSETS WOULD HAVE HELD DOWN OVERALL RETURNS
IN THE BULL MARKET OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN CASH POSITIONS EXCEEDING FIVE PERCENT OF ASSETS WOULD HAVE HELD DOWN OVERALL RETURNS

THE QUESTION IS WHETHER U. S. BANKS WILL BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER U. S. BANKS WILL BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE
THAT'S NOT TO SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR A REBOUND IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS
THE THING THAT MOTIVATES WALL STREET IS SHORT TERM EARNINGS RESULTS AND THEY'RE JUST NOT THERE HE SAYS
AND WE CAN'T TELL YOU WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE
IT MIGHT BE A YEAR OR MORE BEFORE WE GET PAID
FEW OBSERVERS ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE COURT'S OTHER PROBLEMS
ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES OF THE U. S. COURTS ONLY HALF OF THE FIFTY BANKRUPTCY JUDGES WHOSE TERMS EXPIRE BY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL RETURN

IN TODAY'S MARKET THEY ARE ALMOST NEVER AVAILABLE

IN THE BULL MARKET OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN CASH POSITIONS EXCEEDING FIVE PERCENT OF ASSETS WOULD HAVE HELD DOWN OVERALL RETURNS

THE NEED FOR ECONOMY HAS ALSO HELD TO A HANDFUL THE EXPENSIVE BUT ALL IMPORTANT LONGITUDINAL SURVEYS THAT FOLLOW A GROUP OF PEOPLE OVER MANY YEARS
FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE WAY ELDERLY PEOPLE MOVE FROM INDEPENDENT LIVING TO COMMUNITY CARE TO PERHAPS A NURSING HOME OR HOSPITAL

IT SAID VARIOUS LOCAL PLANT ISSUES MUST STILL BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE CONTRACT IS CONCLUDED
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE
WELL TO BEGIN WITH MR. MILKEN ISN'T RUNNING FOR OFFICE OR FOR MR. CONGENIALITY
HE IS THE HEAD OF THE HUGE JUNK BOND OPERATION OF DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED
AND MORE THAN THAT HE IS A CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY'S INSIDER TRADING SCANDAL
IN A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR PAGE CIVIL COMPLAINT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION LAST MONTH ACCUSED THE POWERFUL FINANCIER OF A CATALOG OF SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
HE HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT BEFORE LONG HE MAY BE INDICTED ON CRIMINAL CHARGES
AN F. B. I. REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES REPORTED IN THE U. S. LAST YEAR INCREASED FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THERE WERE THIRTEEN POINT NINE MILLION CRIMES REPORTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
MURDERS ROSE TWO POINT NINE PERCENT TO TWENTY THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE IN THE PERIOD
THE SUIT WAS FILED UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT WHICH ALLOWS PRIVATE CITIZENS TO SUE ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT
UNDER THE LAW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CAN ELECT TO TAKE OVER AS PLAINTIFF
A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE DEPARTMENT SAID NO SUCH DECISION HAS BEEN MADE YET
IN ADDITION I. B. M.'S PRICING STRATEGY COULD HURT COMPETITORS
FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPANY PLANS BIG DISCOUNTS ON THE NEW ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLAR MACHINE FOR SCHOOLS A MAIN APPLE MARKET
ONE OF THE NEW P. C.S OFFERS ALMOST DOUBLE THE MEMORY AND SLIGHTLY MORE STORAGE FOR ELEVEN PERCENT LESS THAN THE COMPETING COMPAQ MACHINE
THE I. B. M. P. C.S TRADITIONALLY ARE PRICED HIGHER THAN RIVAL BRANDS WHICH TYPICALLY MUST UNDERCUT I. B. M. PRICES BY FIFTEEN PERCENT
TASK FORCE REPORT ISN'T ALL BAD
IT DOES CALL FOR ELIMINATING SOME GOVERNMENT OBSTACLES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HEALTHY LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE MARKET
AND THE IDEA OF LETTING EMPLOYERS PRE FUND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSES IS SURELY BETTER THAN HAVING GOVERNMENT DO IT
ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR TREASURY ISSUES LAST WEEK PLUNGED ABOUT THREE POINTS OR ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT

THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS DROPPED TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO OH TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POINT OH ONE
THE DOLLAR WAS LITTLE CHANGED
THAT ASSESSMENT IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE APPROPRIATE NOW MARKET ANALYSTS SAY
ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OF STRONG GROWTH EARLIER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS THE NEW ISSUE MARKET FOR INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES AND EQUITY RELATED BONDS
SUCH ACTIVITY HAS ALL BUT ENDED SINCE STOCK PRICES PLUNGED THE ANALYSTS SAY
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS FUELED THE RISE BY SHIFTING ASSETS TO THE FUNDS IN RESPONSE TO DECLINING RATES AVAILABLE ON SHORT TERM SECURITIES IN THE MARKET
ALSO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS' CONCERN OVER VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE SHE SAID
LAST FRIDAY THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE POSTED ITS THIRD BIGGEST POINT DECLINE EVER
THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED OFF SEVEN POINT FOUR POINTS AT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY POINT SEVEN

JOB SECURITY CLAUSES GIVE UNIONS SOMETHING POSITIVE TO TAKE BACK TO THEIR MEMBERS AT MODEST COST TO EMPLOYERS

THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR AND THE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY HOWEVER ARE NOW ADDING DEMAND AND CAUSING THOSE PRICES TO RISE TOO
THE LOGIC APPARENTLY IS THAT WE'LL HAVE TO RAISE OUR RATES TO DEFEND THE DOLLAR SAID PETER CANELO A PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT BEAR STEARNS
BUT HE SAID THAT WOULD ONLY BE TRUE IF THE DOLLAR WERE WEAK
SINCE THE U. S. CURRENCY HAS STRENGTHENED SHARPLY IN RECENT WEEKS HE SEES NO NEED FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO PROTECT THE DOLLAR

THAT COULD TAKE YEARS
THE PRICE FOR THE CITICORP UNIT WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE SOURCES ADD IN LINE WITH EARLIER ESTIMATES

IT IS THE GENERIC STAND IN FOR THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF OUR AGE MR. MURRAY WRITES
SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF POVERTY WE HAVE OFTEN SEEMED TO HOPE AND THE REST OF OUR PROBLEMS WILL SOLVE THEMSELVES

WE LOOK FOR HIGHER THAN STANDARD RETURNS MR. SPERLING SAYS
IN TODAY'S MARKET THEY ARE ALMOST NEVER AVAILABLE
THERE ARE TOO MANY FOREIGN AND INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS WILLING TO PAY HIGHER PRICES THAN WE ARE
THE NEED FOR ECONOMY HAS ALSO HELD TO A HANDFUL THE EXPENSIVE BUT ALL IMPORTANT LONGITUDINAL SURVEYS THAT FOLLOW A GROUP OF PEOPLE OVER MANY YEARS
FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE WAY ELDERLY PEOPLE MOVE FROM INDEPENDENT LIVING TO COMMUNITY CARE TO PERHAPS A NURSING HOME OR HOSPITAL
WITH SUCH KNOWLEDGE PLANNERS COULD BETTER DETERMINE WHETHER MORE COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES COULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR NURSING HOMES OR HOSPITALS
STERLING DRUG INCORPORATED INCREASED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND FIFTEEN PERCENT TO THIRTY EIGHT CENTS A SHARE FROM THIRTY THREE CENTS

THE COMPANY SAID THE WESTERN COUNCIL OF INDUSTRIAL WORKERS RATIFIED ECONOMIC TERMS OF THE NEW THREE YEAR AGREEMENT ON FRIDAY
IT SAID VARIOUS LOCAL PLANT ISSUES MUST STILL BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE CONTRACT IS CONCLUDED
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE
WELL TO BEGIN WITH MR. MILKEN ISN'T RUNNING FOR OFFICE OR FOR MR. CONGENIALITY
HE IS THE HEAD OF THE HUGE JUNK BOND OPERATION OF DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED
AND MORE THAN THAT HE IS A CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY'S INSIDER TRADING SCANDAL
IN A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR PAGE CIVIL COMPLAINT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION LAST MONTH ACCUSED THE POWERFUL FINANCIER OF A CATALOG OF SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
HE HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT BEFORE LONG HE MAY BE INDICTED ON CRIMINAL CHARGES
AN F. B. I. REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES REPORTED IN THE U. S. LAST YEAR INCREASED FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THERE WERE THIRTEEN POINT NINE MILLION CRIMES REPORTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
MURDERS ROSE TWO POINT NINE PERCENT TO TWENTY THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE IN THE PERIOD
THE SUIT WAS FILED UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT WHICH ALLOWS PRIVATE CITIZENS TO SUE ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT
UNDER THE LAW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CAN ELECT TO TAKE OVER AS PLAINTIFF
A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE DEPARTMENT SAID NO SUCH DECISION HAS BEEN MADE YET
IN ADDITION I. B. M.'S PRICING STRATEGY COULD HURT COMPETITORS
FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPANY PLANS BIG DISCOUNTS ON THE NEW ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLAR MACHINE FOR SCHOOLS A MAIN APPLE MARKET
ONE OF THE NEW P. C.S OFFERS ALMOST DOUBLE THE MEMORY AND SLIGHTLY MORE STORAGE FOR ELEVEN PERCENT LESS THAN THE COMPETING COMPAQ MACHINE
I. B. M. P. C.S TRADITIONALLY ARE PRICED HIGHER THAN RIVAL BRANDS WHICH TYPICALLY MUST UNDERCUT I. B. M. PRICES BY FIFTEEN PERCENT
THE TASK FORCE REPORT ISN'T ALL BAD
IT DOES CALL FOR ELIMINATING SOME GOVERNMENT OBSTACLES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HEALTHY LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE MARKET
AND THE IDEA OF LETTING EMPLOYERS PRE FUND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSES IS SURELY BETTER THAN HAVING GOVERNMENT DO IT
ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR TREASURY ISSUES LAST WEEK PLUNGED ABOUT THREE POINTS OR ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
PRICES WERE DOWN EVERY DAY BUT THURSDAY WHEN THEY ROSE ONLY SLIGHTLY
